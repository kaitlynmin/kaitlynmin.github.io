### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was a favorite because I had always heard of the game Blackjack, but never knew how it worked. It was really interesting learning the point system while trying to create a program that calculates the points, because it felt like I was learning along with the computer. I enjoyed the experience of learning both Blackjack and programming. 

* Lab 6 

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because it was the first time I programmed soemething more visual-based. Unlike the previous labs, where I started coding head-on, I had to sit down and think carefully about how to write each loop. In the end, I had a much more solid idea of what loops were, how to write them, and got to see an aesthetically pleasing pattern. 

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because it was one of the first times we used more then one file. The spell check task was also interesting because I often wonder how certain things are automated, and I was able to learn how. Also, since we are now able to code using outside sources, it feels like we are able to do much more, since previously we could only use the specific input or output we directly asked for.
